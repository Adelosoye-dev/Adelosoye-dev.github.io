          <h2>I'm <span style="color:#FEEAFA" data-testid="slackDisplayName">Adelosoye Olajumoke</span>
            , a budding front-end developer with 1
                year experience in the tech industry. Though fairly new, Iâ€™m
                enthusiastic about exploring new technologies and continually
                expanding my skill set.
                I have been able to explore certain aspects of web design and
                development, and the more I learn, the more I want to know. I
                recently started an internship with HNG, and it has been
                incredibly helpful in my journey. The hands-on experience has
                significantly enhanced my skills and understanding of the field.
                In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects that
                challenge me to apply what I've learned and experiment with new
                technologies. I'm excited about the future and looking forward to
                contributing to innovative projects and collaborating with other
                tech enthusiasts.
